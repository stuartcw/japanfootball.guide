# Club Life

## Uniforms

Around the start of the year, or depending on the club before the season ends, the new uniforms are announced and many fans will rush to order on the first day. It is normal for fans to buy a new uniform every year and wear it for the entire season.

You do also see fans wearing old and retro uniforms to matches especially with the names of beloved and iconic players who left the club, or this earth, on good terms. Buying an old shirt with a name without knowing the player’s history could raise eyebrows or be a talking point.

It is more usual to wear a uniform than not. Some ultra groups make a point of wearing their own t-shirts. If you attend regularly there is some expectation that you will wear some kind of kit.

If you are going to buy, it’s best to bite the bullet at the start of the year or you may find that this year’s uniform is sold out, only to be available again in the summer. Some clubs have a cheap version which is a rough replica of the official kit but don’t expect much quality.

After the season has got underway, don’t be surprised if more uniforms are announced. Many clubs have special uniforms for the Asian Cup, with the players “real names” on the back or special cup uniforms, home and away for the Nabisco and Emperors cup.

There are also commemorative uniforms for certain players who have reached a landmark number of games and for club events like the completion of a new stand, matches with European Clubs on their summer tour or even just because it is summer.

If you get addicted to having the latest and greatest uniform, expect to have deep pockets. Uniform sales are an important part of the club revenue and their business models.

Ultra groups who spend all their money attending all of the games often forgoe uniforms and wear their own group tshirts and scarves. Some of these can be real cool. Be aware though that by wearing their tshirt you are now seen to be one of the group so if they get in trouble with club, you may too.

## Training

### Pre season Camp

Each year around January or February clubs go to the south of Japan for training camps. The local of the camps and schedule is advertised and fans often go there to watch the training. If you are lucky you may even be staying in the same hotel as the players and bump into them in the hotel.

### Training matches

Regular training matches and training schedules are advertised on the club's home page and are often open to the public. Supporting is not allowed so banners, flags and chants won't be heard but it is a good chance to see all the squad and also who is there or not may give you a clue about injuries and fitness problems.

## Fan Service

Club also advertise "fan service" events where you are able to meet the players and get photographs with them and have them sign your shirt. Theses are advertised on the club's home page and may be well attended. Usually they are after the training session ends.

Depending on the size and prestige of the club the player interaction may be limited. For example, the players may not interact with the fans and just pause for a photo or a sign. Certain players may skip the event on a particular day or may move quickly down the line so don't bank on seeing any particular player.

## Special Events

Some clubs offer special events with the players like a year festival when the players do some song and dance performance on stage, attend booths for signing goods and mingle with the fans. Ask a fan of the club if they do this. At fan events they may also sell old goods at discounted prices so you may be able to pick up a cheap uniform from  a previous year especially if the player is unpopular or you are buying a very large size that is not the typical Japanese size. It is worth having one extra large uniform to wear over warm layers in the winter or early spring matches.

## Fan Club

Each club has an official fan club. All materials will be in Japanese so it may not be so interesting if you are not fluent in the language however they do often organize official away tours by bus and other transport, discounts on goods bought at the club shop and early ticket sales for home and away matches. It is usually worth the money to be a fan club member.

## Fan Tours

Clubs organize official away tours to away matches depending on the popularity and likelihood of people attending it. Supporter groups also organize bus tours to away matches if you make friends with Japanese supporters they may invite you onto their bus to make up the numbers. The fan buses can be one of the cheapest ways to get to an away venue and are very well organised.

## International Travel

For ACL matches abroad and special away practices matches clubs may organize a tour. Going to an international away match is probably the peak in fandom and you will gain many brownie points for showing up at one.
