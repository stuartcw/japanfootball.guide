## Japan Ultra Culture

### The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

What constitutes an Ultra?

* Travels to all games home and away
* Stands, often jumping throughout the match
* Creates large banners and displays them home and away
* Sings throughout the match
* Stands behind the goal
* Waves a flag during the match. Does not worry about being a flag during the match.
* Wear club uniform or tshirt belonging to their group

### Trouble at matches

In Japan, there is very little trouble. If you come from Europe you may be surprised at the almost total lack of stewards and police at stadiums. Rival fans travel on the same trains to the matches with no trouble.

Overseas much trouble is related to alcohol. In Japan many ultra fans don't drink before matches, mainly because they low tolerance for alcohol and some have told me that they are only allowed to drink after the match if the team wins! If you like like to drink a lot it is probably better to stay on the fringes of the ultra area.

### The role of the Call Leader

The call leader's role varies from club to club but usually the club liaises with the call leader to give messages and direction to the fans. Large TIFO and displays are organized by the call leaders group.

You'll recognize the call leader by his megaphone and by him, and only him, kicking off the chants during the match where he functions as a musical director. The call leader also is responsible for deciding which songs to sing, when to sing them and for introducing new songs to the supporters.

They vary from friendly to downright scary characters. As with many groups in Japan you are likely to be ignored until you prove that you are serious and are going to stick around. Once accepted they may be very generous to you.

#### Social Media

### Flags

Japanese ultras like flags. Some will bring large flags and wave them in a rotating motion for the whole of the match. If you stand in the Ultra area or behind the Ultras don't be surprised if you can't see the match without a flag obstructing your view every second. At one match I went to, the guy in front of me had a dirty beach table umbrella painted in faded club colours which somewhat obscured the view. I swear that I saw a rotating barbers pole at one match in the distance behind the goal.

### Jumping

Japanese ultras like jumping. I don't know how they do it but some crazies jump for the whole of the 90 minutes. If you stand in the ultra area you will be expected to jump when they do. If you come as a group that don't jump it may look like you are taking up space which could be used by people who would jump.

If jumping is not your scene then it might be better to sit a little away from the jumping area. However, unless you go to an away match, you probably can't sit in the jumping area unless someone invites you in as you won't be line early enough to get a spot there. If you do get invited then there is somewhat of an obligation to join in.

### Chants
