# Introduction

## Introduction

This is a work in progress. Hopefully it will remain as such and continue to grow to be an up to date and informative guide to supporting football in Japan.

## Purpose

The aim of this guide is to get you up and running supporting a Japanese football team. It only covers Japan and is also aiming towards supporting a team rather than supporting Japanese football in general. Another guide could be "Ground-hopping in Japan" which is an interesting topic in itself.

Much of this guide refers to the men's J1 division but much of the information could carry over to the other divisions and ladies football. Definitely feel free to contact us if you have additional information or content to broaden our coverage.

## Terminology

There may be some words used which are in Japanese. They will be listed in the Terminology Appendix at the end. Feel free to contact us if anything is unclear.
