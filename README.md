# Introduction

## Introduction

This is a work in progress. Hopefully I'll be able to finish the finish the first draft before giving and moving onto something else.

## Purpose

The aim of this guide is to get you up and running supporting a Japanese football team. It only covers Japan and is also aiming towards supporting a team rather than supporting Japanese football in general. Another guide could be "Groundhopping in Japan" which is an interesting topic in itself.&#x20;

The guide mainly refers to the male J1 division but much of the information could carry over to the other divisions and ladies football.

## Terminology

There may be some words used which are in Japanese they will be listed in the Terminology Appendix at the end.
